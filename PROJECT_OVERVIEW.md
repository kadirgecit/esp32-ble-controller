## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### ESP32 Components
- **BLE Stack**: Native ESP32 BLE for device communication
- **Web Server**: AsyncWebServer for HTTP API and file serving
- **WebSocket**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **SPIFFS**: File system for web interface and data storage
- **WiFi**: Network connectivity for web interface access

### Web Interface
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Communication**: REST API + WebSocket for real-time updates
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage + ESP32 SPIFFS persistence
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid/Flexbox

### Data Flow
1. **Scanning**: ESP32 scans → WebSocket → Real-time UI updates
2. **Connection**: Web UI → REST API → ESP32 BLE connection
3. **Commands**: Web form → REST API → BLE characteristic write
4. **Storage**: Web UI → REST API → SPIFFS JSON files

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For ESP32 Hardware
1. Install Arduino IDE with ESP32 support
2. Install required libraries (see libraries.txt)
3. Upload web files to SPIFFS
4. Configure WiFi credentials in sketch
5. Upload sketch to ESP32
6. Access web interface via ESP32's IP address

### For Demo/Testing
1. Run the demo server: `python simple_demo_server.py`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:12000`
3. Explore the interface with simulated BLE devices

## 🎮 Usage Workflow

### Basic Operation
1. **Scan**: Discover nearby BLE devices
2. **Connect**: Establish connection to target device
3. **Explore**: Load services and characteristics
4. **Command**: Send data to device characteristics
5. **Save**: Store devices and commands for reuse

### Advanced Features
- **Batch Operations**: Execute multiple commands in sequence
- **Device Profiles**: Create command sets for specific device types
- **Monitoring**: Real-time activity logging and status updates
- **Management**: Organize and maintain device/command libraries

## 🔌 Supported Device Types

### Standard BLE Services
- Heart Rate Monitors (Service: 180D)
- Battery Services (Service: 180F)
- Environmental Sensors (Service: 181A)
- Device Information (Service: 180A)

### Custom Devices
- LED Controllers and Smart Lights
- IoT Sensors and Actuators
- Custom Arduino/ESP32 BLE devices
- Smart Home Devices
- Fitness Trackers

## 🛠️ API Reference

### REST Endpoints
- `GET /api/scan` - Start BLE scanning
- `GET /api/stop-scan` - Stop BLE scanning
- `POST /api/connect` - Connect to device
- `GET /api/disconnect` - Disconnect current device
- `POST /api/send-command` - Send BLE command
- `GET /api/get-services` - Get device services
- `GET/POST /api/devices` - Manage saved devices
- `GET/POST/DELETE /api/commands` - Manage saved commands

### WebSocket Messages
- `SCAN_STARTED/STOPPED` - Scan status updates
- `SCAN_RESULT:{json}` - New device discovered
- `CONNECTED:{address}` - Device connection established
- `DISCONNECTED` - Device disconnected

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Network Security
- Web interface is unprotected (use on trusted networks)
- Consider adding authentication for production use
- HTTPS support recommended for remote access

### BLE Security
- Respects device pairing requirements
- No automatic pairing (user-controlled)
- Command validation and error handling
- Connection timeout and cleanup
