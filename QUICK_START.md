## ðŸ†˜ Quick Troubleshooting

**ESP32 won't connect to WiFi?**
- Check SSID/password spelling
- Ensure 2.4GHz network (not 5GHz)
- Move closer to router

**Web interface won't load?**
- Check Serial Monitor for IP address
- Verify SPIFFS upload completed
- Try different browser

**No BLE devices found?**
- Ensure target devices are advertising
- Check device distance (stay within 30 feet)
- Try restarting target devices

**Commands not working?**
- Verify UUIDs are correct
- Check data format (hex vs string)
- Ensure device is still connected

## ðŸ“š Next Steps

1. **Read the full README.md** for detailed information
2. **Check EXAMPLES.md** for device-specific examples
3. **Review TROUBLESHOOTING.md** if you encounter issues
4. **Explore the Services tab** to discover device capabilities
5. **Customize config.h** for advanced settings

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Ready!

Your ESP32 BLE Controller is now ready to scan, connect, and control BLE devices. Start with simple devices like LED controllers or fitness trackers, then move on to more complex applications.

**Happy BLE controlling!** ðŸš€
